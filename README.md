# About Me- Portfolio

My name is Allyse D. Johnson. The purpose of this project was to present my portfolio using React for both the front-end and page routes. In this, I have included links for some of my latest projects, contact information and a short bio. To view this document one would need to first clone the github repo then run `npm install` to install all dependencies needed. If you want to include me in a project, please reach out to me by the contact info I've icluded in my contact page.
